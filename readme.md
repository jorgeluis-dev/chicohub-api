# 🐾 ChicoHub – Integrated Pet Management Ecosystem

**ChicoHub** is a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to modernize pet shop operations through a robust, secure, and scalable architecture. This repository serves as the central hub for all modules of the enterprise.

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

The project is structured into specialized modules to ensure high availability and maintainability:

* **`/api` (Backend Core):** The heart of the system. Built with **Java 17** and **Spring Boot 3**, it manages business logic, Google OAuth2 security, and data persistence.
* **`/docs` (Infrastructure & Specs):** Centralized documentation regarding the infrastructure architecture and database modeling.

## 🚀 Key Enterprise Features

* **Containerized Environment:** The entire ecosystem is orchestrated via **Docker**, allowing for one-command deployment across any environment.
* **Unified Identity Management:** Centralized authentication using **OIDC/OAuth2** to ensure data privacy and secure access across all future modules.
* **Service-Oriented Design:** Ready for expansion into mobile (React Native) or frontend (React/Next.js) interfaces.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Core)

* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL.
* **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Linux (Ubuntu).
* **Security:** Spring Security, Google OAuth2.
